              techniques for profiling gene expression in single cells do not
              directly capture transcriptional dynamics. In the present study,
              we present a method for combined single-cell combinatorial
              indexing and messenger RNA labeling (sci-fate), which uses
              combinatorial cell indexing and 4-thiouridine labeling of newly
              synthesized mRNA to concurrently profile the whole and newly
              synthesized transcriptome in each of many single cells. We used
              sci-fate to study the cortisol response in >6,000 single cultured
              cells. From these data, we quantified the dynamics of the cell
              cycle and glucocorticoid receptor activation, and explored their
              intersection. Finally, we developed software to infer and analyze
              cell-state transitions. We anticipate that sci-fate will be
              broadly applicable to quantitatively characterize transcriptional
              dynamics in diverse systems.",

              example, the same genetic program, comprising sequential changes

              neurons in mouse and human, but the tempo at which it operates

              approximately two-fold increase in protein stability and cell

              between endothelial (E), HE, and IAC cells, and the heterogeneity
              of HSPCs within IACs, we profiled ∼40 000 cells from the caudal
              arteries (dorsal aorta, umbilical, vitelline) of 9.5 days post
              coitus (dpc) to 11.5 dpc mouse embryos by single-cell RNA

  abstract = "Abstract Single-cell analysis is a powerful technique used to
              identify a specific cell population of interest during
              differentiation, aging, or oncogenesis. Individual cells occupy a
              particular transient state in the cell cycle, circadian rhythm,
              or during cell death. An appealing concept of pseudo-time
              trajectory analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data was
              proposed in the software Monocle, and several methods of
              trajectory analysis have since been published to date. These aim
              to infer the ordering of cells and enable the tracing of gene
              expression profile trajectories in cell differentiation and
              reprogramming. However, the methods are restricted in terms of
              time structure because of the pre-specified structure of
              trajectories (linear, branched, tree or cyclic) which contrasts
              with the mixed state of single cells.Here, we propose a technique
              to extract underlying flows in single-cell data based on the
              Hodge decomposition (HD). HD is a theorem of vector fields on a
              manifold which guarantees that any given flow can decompose into
              three types of orthogonal component: gradient-flow (acyclic),
              curl-, and harmonic-flow (cyclic). HD is generalized on a
              simplicial complex (graph) and the discretized HD has only a weak
              assumption that the graph is directed. Therefore, in principle,
              HD can extract flows from any mixture of tree and cyclic time
              flows of observed cells. The decomposed flows provide intuitive
              interpretations about complex flow because of their linearity and
              orthogonality. Thus, each extracted flow can be focused on
              separately with no need to consider crosstalk.We developed
              ddhodge software, which aims to model the underlying flow
              structure that implies unobserved time or causal relations in the
              hodge-podge collection of data points. We demonstrated that the
              mathematical framework of HD is suitable to reconstruct a sparse
              graph representation of diffusion process as a candidate model of
              differentiation while preserving the divergence of the original
              fully-connected graph. The preserved divergence can be used as an
              indicator of the source and sink cells in the observed
              population. A sparse graph representation of the diffusion
              process transforms data analysis of the non-linear structure
              embedded in the high-dimensional space of single-cell data into
              inspection of the visible flow using graph algorithms. Hence,
              ddhodge is a suitable toolkit to visualize, inspect, and
              subsequently interpret large data sets including, but not limited
              to, high-throughput measurements of biological data.The beta

              have been developed to utilize these data. Here we compare and
              contrast two approaches for building mathematical models of cell
              state-transitions with single-cell RNA-sequencing data with
              hematopoeisis as a model system; by solving partial differential
              equations on a graph representing discrete cell state
              relationships, and by solving the equations on a continuous cell
              state-space. We demonstrate how to calibrate model parameters
              from single or multiple time-point single-cell sequencing data,
              and examine the effects of data processing algorithms on the
              model calibration and predictions. As an application of our
              approach, we demonstrate how the calibrated models may be used to
              mathematically perturb normal hematopoeisis to simulate, predict,
              and study the emergence of novel cell types during the
              pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. The mathematical modeling
              framework we present is general and can be applied to study cell
              state-transitions in any single-cell genome sequencing
              dataset.Author summary Here we compare and contrast graph- and
              continuum-based approaches for constructing mathematical models
              of cell state-transitions using single-cell RNA-sequencing data.
              Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate how to
              calibrate mathematical models of hematopoeisis and how to use the
              models to predict dynamics of acute myeloid leukemia pathogenesis
              by mathematically perturbing the process of cellular
              proliferation and differentiation. We apply these modeling
              approaches to study the effects of perturbing individual or sets
              of genes in subsets of cells, or by modeling the dynamics of cell
              state-transitions directly in a reduced dimensional space. We
              examine the effects of different graph abstraction and trajectory
              inference algorithms on calibrating the models and the subsequent
              model predictions. We conclude that both the graph- and
              continuum-based modeling approaches can be equally well
              calibrated to data and discuss situations in which one method may
              be preferable over the other. This work presents a general
              mathematical modeling framework, applicable to any single-cell
              sequencing dataset where cell state-transitions are of interest.",

              Detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of the infection is
              indispensable for understanding of the viral replication, host

              expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA
              miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited
              approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon

              cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or
              IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical
              interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly
              induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4)

              describing the phenotypic transition dynamics. A popular picture
              proposed by Waddington views cell differentiation as a ball
              sliding down a landscape with valleys corresponding to different
              cell types separated by ridges. Based on theories of dynamical
              systems, we establish a novel 'epigenetic state network'
              framework that captures the global architecture of cell
              phenotypes, which allows us to translate the metaphorical
              low-dimensional Waddington epigenetic landscape concept into a
              simple-yet-predictive rigorous mathematical framework of cell
              phenotypic transitions. Specifically, we simplify a
              high-dimensional epigenetic landscape into a collection of
              discrete states corresponding to stable cell phenotypes connected
              by optimal transition pathways among them. We then apply the
              approach to the phenotypic transition processes among fibroblasts

              The epigenetic state network for this case predicts three major
              transition pathways connecting FBs and CMs. One goes by way of
              PSCs. The other two pathways involve transdifferentiation either
              indirectly through cardiac progenitor cells or directly from FB
              to CM. The predicted pathways and multiple intermediate states
              are supported by existing microarray data and other experiments.
              Our approach provides a theoretical framework for studying cell

              uncovered correlated gene modules (CGMs), clusters of
              intercorrelated genes that carry out certain biological functions
              together. We report a novel single-cell RNA-seq method called

              determination of the covariance matrix of the expressed mRNAs for

              inaccessible contexts, necessitating approaches other than direct

              in a format that can be subsequently read out of single cells in
              situ. This system, termed memory by engineered mutagenesis with
              optical in situ readout (MEMOIR), is based on a set of barcoded
              recording elements termed scratchpads. The state of a given
              scratchpad can be irreversibly altered by CRISPR/Cas9-based

              multiplexed single-molecule RNA fluorescence hybridization

              poorly to whole, complex organisms. Here, we use genome editing
              to progressively introduce and accumulate diverse mutations in a
              DNA barcode over multiple rounds of cell division. The barcode,
              an array of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic

              elucidation of lineage relationships via the patterns of

              show that rates and patterns of editing are tunable and that
              thousands of lineage-informative barcode alleles can be
              generated. By sampling hundreds of thousands of cells from

               \#\#\# INTRODUCTION The copy number and intracellular
               localization of RNA are important regulators of gene expression.
               Measurement of these properties at the transcriptome scale in
               single cells will give answers to many questions related to gene
               expression and regulation. Single-molecule RNA imaging
               approaches, such as single-molecule fluorescence in situ
               hybridization (smFISH), are powerful tools for counting and
               mapping RNA; however, the number of RNA species that can be
               simultaneously imaged in individual cells has been limited. This
               makes it challenging to perform transcriptomic analysis of
               single cells in a spatially resolved manner. Here, we report
               multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH), a single-molecule
               imaging method that allows thousands of RNA species to be imaged
               in single cells by using combinatorial FISH labeling with
               encoding schemes capable of detecting and/or correcting errors.
               \#\#\# RATIONALE We labeled each cellular RNA with a set of
               encoding probes, which contain targeting sequences that bind the
               RNA and readout sequences that bind fluorescently labeled
               readout probes. Each RNA species is encoded with a particular
               combination of readout sequences. We used successive rounds of
               hybridization and imaging, each with a different readout probe,
               to identify the readout sequences bound to each RNA and to
               decode the RNA. In principle, combinatorial labeling allows the
               number of detectable RNA species to grow exponentially with the
               number of imaging rounds, but the detection errors also increase
               exponentially. To combat such accumulating errors, we exploited
               error-robust encoding schemes used in digital electronics, such
               as the extended Hamming code, in the design of our encoding
               probes but modified these schemes in order to account for the
               error properties in FISH measurements. We assigned each RNA a
               binary word in our modified Hamming code and encoded the RNA
               with a combination of readout sequences according to this binary
               word. \#\#\# RESULTS We first imaged 140 RNA species in human
               fibroblast cells using MERFISH with 16 rounds of hybridization
               and a modified Hamming code capable of both error detection and
               correction. We obtained ~80\% detection efficiency and observed
               excellent correlation of RNA copy numbers determined with
               MERFISH with both bulk RNA sequencing data and conventional
               smFISH measurements of individual genes. Next, we used an
               alternative MERFISH encoding scheme, which is capable of
               detecting but not correcting errors, to image 1001 RNA species
               in individual cells using only 14 rounds of hybridization. The
               observed RNA copy numbers again correlate well with bulk
               sequencing data. However, the detection efficiency is only
               one-third that of the error-correcting encoding scheme. We
               performed correlation analysis of the 104 to 106 pairs of
               measured genes and identified many covarying gene groups that
               share common regulatory elements. Such grouping allowed us to
               hypothesize potential functions of ~100 unannotated or partially
               annotated genes of unknown functions. We further analyzed
               correlations in the spatial distributions of different RNA
               species and identified groups of RNAs with different
               distribution patterns in the cell. \#\#\# DISCUSSION This highly
               multiplexed imaging approach enables analyses based on the
               variation and correlation of copy numbers and spatial
               distributions of a large number of RNA species within single
               cells. Such analyses should facilitate the delineation of
               regulatory networks and in situ identification of cell types. We
               envision that this approach will allow spatially resolved
               transcriptomes to be determined for single cells. ![Figure][2]
               MERFISH for transcriptome imaging. Numerous RNA species can be
               identified, counted, and localized in a single cell by using
               MERFISH, a single-molecule imaging approach that uses
               combinatorial labeling and sequential imaging with encoding
               schemes capable of detection and/or correction of errors. This
               highly multiplexed measurement of individual RNAs can be used to
               compute the gene expression profile and noise, covariation in
               expression among different genes, and spatial distribution of
               RNAs within single cells. Knowledge of the expression profile
               and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells
               is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular
               behaviors. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence
               in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging
               approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations
               of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells.
               Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule
               labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of
               100 to 1000 distinct RNA species in hundreds of individual
               cells. Correlation analysis of the ~104 to 106 pairs of genes
               allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel
               functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct
               spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with
               properties of the encoded proteins. [1]:

  abstract = "Recent progress in stem cell biology, notably cell fate
              conversion, calls for novel theoretical understanding for cell

              ``epigenetic landscape'' has attracted particular attention
              because it captures subsequent fate decision points, thus
              manifesting the hierarchical (``tree-like'') nature of cell fate
              diversification. Here, we generalized a recent work and explored
              such a developmental landscape for a two-gene fate decision
              circuit by integrating the underlying probability landscapes with
              different parameters (corresponding to distinct developmental
              stages). The change of entropy production rate along the
              parameter changes indicates which parameter changes can represent
              a normal developmental process while other parameters' change can
              not. The transdifferentiation paths over the landscape under
              certain conditions reveal the possibility of a direct and
              reversible phenotypic conversion. As the intensity of noise
              increases, we found that the landscape becomes flatter and the
              dominant paths more straight, implying the importance of
              biological noise processing mechanism in development and

              investigate steady state levels of gene expression. However,
              being able to differentiate pre-existing RNA (that has been
              synthesized prior to a defined point in time) and newly
              transcribed RNA can provide invaluable information e.g. to
              estimate RNA half-lives or identify fast and complex regulatory
              processes. Recently, new techniques based on metabolic labeling
              and RNA-seq have emerged that allow to quantify new and old RNA:
              Nucleoside analogs are incorporated into newly transcribed RNA
              and are made detectable as point mutations in mapped reads.
              However, relatively infrequent incorporation events and
              significant sequencing error rates make the differentiation
              between old and new RNA a highly challenging task. We developed a
              statistical approach termed GRAND-SLAM that, for the first time,
              allows to estimate the proportion of old and new RNA in such an
              experiment. Uncertainty in the estimates is quantified in a
              Bayesian framework. Simulation experiments show our approach to
              be unbiased and highly accurate. Furthermore, we analyze how
              uncertainty in the proportion translates into uncertainty in
              estimating RNA half-lives and give guidelines for planning
              experiments. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimates of RNA
              half-lives compare favorably to other experimental approaches and
              that biological processes affecting RNA half-lives can be
              investigated with greater power than offered by any other method.

              transcription factors stabilize progenitor cells and resolve
              their indeterminacy to commit them to discrete, mutually
              exclusive fates remains unexplained. We used a simple model and

              fate decision governed by a gene-circuit containing
              auto-stimulation and cross-inhibition, as embodied by the
              GATA1-PU.1 paradigm. This circuit generates stable attractors
              corresponding to erythroid and myelomonocytic fates, as well as
              an uncommitted metastable state characterized by coexpression of

              gene expression changes over time. However, some information on
              dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular
              states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical
              cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from
              population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts
              face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell

              and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying

              gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static

    The RNA velocity provides a new avenue to study the stemness and lineage of cells in the development in scRNA-seq data analysis. Some promising extensions of it are proposed and the community is experiencing a fast developing period.
    However, in this stage, it is of prime importance to revisit the whole process of RNA
    velocity analysis from the mathematical point of view, which will help to understand
    the rationale and drawbacks of different proposals. The current paper is devoted to
    this purpose. We present a thorough mathematical study on the RNA velocity model
    from dynamics to downstream data analysis. We derived the analytical solution of
    the RNA velocity model from both deterministic and stochastic point of view. We
    presented the parameter inference framework based on the maximum likelihood estimate. We also derived the continuum limit of different downstream analysis methods,
    which provides insights on the construction of transition probability matrix, root and
    ending-cells identification, and the development routes finding. The overall analysis
    aims at providing a mathematical basis for more advanced design and development
    of RNA velocity type methods in the future.

              and extracellular signals specifying NCSC lineages remain to be
              identified, and we have only a little idea of how and when they
              function together to control fate. Zebrafish have three neural
              crest-derived pigment cell types, black melanocytes,
              light-reflecting iridophores and yellow xanthophores, which offer
              a powerful model for studying the molecular and cellular
              mechanisms of fate segregation. Mitfa has been identified as the
              master regulator of melanocyte fate. Here, we show that an
              Mitf-related transcription factor, Tfec, functions as master
              regulator of the iridophore fate. Surprisingly, our phenotypic
              analysis of tfec mutants demonstrates that Tfec also functions in

              although the melanocyte and xanthophore lineages recover later.
              We show that Mitfa represses tfec expression, revealing a likely

              are rare and interactions between SMAD and other transcription
              factors define pro-oncogenic events. Here, we have performed
              chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing analyses which
              indicate that the genome-wide landscape of SMAD2/3 binding is
              altered after prolonged TGF$\beta$ stimulation. De novo motif

               to the modern concepts of gene regulatory networks and gene
               expression noise. Both can, in the absence of genetic mutations,
               jointly generate a diversity of inheritable randomly occupied
               phenotypic states that could also serve as a substrate for
               natural selection. This form of epigenetic dynamics challenges
               Neo-Darwinism. It needs to incorporate the non-linear,
               stochastic dynamics of gene networks. A first step is to
               consider the mathematical correspondence between gene regulatory

              the simultaneous measurement of clonal history and cell identity
              at single-cell resolution, which has been a major challenge.
              Clonal history has traditionally been investigated by
              microscopically tracking cells during development, monitoring the
              heritable expression of genetically encoded fluorescent proteins
              and, more recently, using next-generation sequencing technologies
              that exploit somatic mutations, microsatellite instability,
              transposon tagging, viral barcoding, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing
              and Cre-loxP recombination. Single-cell transcriptomics provides
              a powerful platform for unbiased cell-type classification. Here

              cell type for thousands of cells obtained from different organs

              specific cell types in the eyes and brain. In addition, we study
              when embryonic progenitors commit to the left or right eye.
              ScarTrace reveals that epidermal and mesenchymal cells in the
              caudal fin arise from the same progenitors, and that
              osteoblast-restricted precursors can produce mesenchymal cells

              developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of

              accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide
              insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is
              systematically associated with specific trans-factors and
              cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors
              associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell

              with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell
              types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription
              factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this

              initially proposed by S. Wright over 70 years ago, reintroduced
              by one of the founders of molecular biology and by others in
              different biological contexts, but apparently forgotten by modern
              biologists for many years. Nevertheless, this concept finds an
              increasingly important role in the development of systems biology
              and bionetwork dynamics modeling, from phage lambda genetic
              switch to endogenous network for cancer genesis and progression.
              It is an ideal quantification to describe the robustness and
              stability of bionetworks. Here, I will first introduce five
              landmark proposals in biology on this concept, to demonstrate an
              important common thread in theoretical biology. Then I will
              discuss a few recent results, focusing on the studies showing
              theoretical consistency of adaptive landscape. From the
              perspective of a working scientist and of what is needed

              the adaptive landscape is useful both metaphorically and

              understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative
              analysis of relatively simple systems. Here we present a
              complementary approach to this problem: the design and
              construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular
              function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that
              are not part of any natural biological clock to build an
              oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia

              cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours,
              are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the
              oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation.
              This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because
              of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational

There are no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19, nor are there any vaccines that prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, and efforts to develop drugs and vaccines are hampered by the limited knowledge of the molecular details of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells. Here we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins that physically associated with each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins using affinity-purification mass spectrometry, identifying 332 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (of which, 29 drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 12 are in clinical trials and 28 are preclinical compounds). We screened a subset of these in multiple viral assays and found two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. Further studies of these host-factor-targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.",

              interplay of host factors and hundreds of viral genes.
              Understanding how they work together and how perturbations of
              viral and host factors impact infection represents both a
              fundamental problem in virology and the basis for designing
              antiviral interventions. Here, we use CRISPR screening to
              comprehensively define the functional contribution of each viral
              and host factor to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in
              primary cells. We then record the transcriptomes of tens of
              thousands of single cells, and monitor how genetic perturbation
              of critical host and viral factors alters the timing, course, and
              progression of infection. We find that normally, the large
              majority of cells follow a stereotypical transcriptional
              trajectory. Perturbing critical host factors does not change this
              trajectory per se, but can either stall, delay or accelerate
              progression along the trajectory, allowing us to pinpoint
              systematically the stage of infection at which each host factor
              acts. Conversely, perturbation of viral factors can create
              distinct, abortive trajectories. Our results reveal a dichotomy
              between the roles of host and viral factors and more generally

    abstract = {During tissue development, patterns of gene expression determine the spatial arrangement of cell types. In many cases, gradients of secreted signalling molecules—morphogens—guide this process by controlling downstream transcriptional networks. A mechanism commonly used in these networks to convert the continuous information provided by the gradient into discrete transitions between adjacent cell types is the genetic toggle switch, composed of cross-repressing transcriptional determinants. Previous analyses have emphasised the steady state output of these mechanisms. Here, we explore the dynamics of the toggle switch and use exact numerical simulations of the kinetic reactions, the corresponding Chemical Langevin Equation, and Minimum Action Path theory to establish a framework for studying the effect of gene expression noise on patterning time and boundary position. This provides insight into the time scale, gene expression trajectories and directionality of stochastic switching events between cell states. Taking gene expression noise into account predicts that the final boundary position of a morphogen-induced toggle switch, although robust to changes in the details of the noise, is distinct from that of the deterministic system. Moreover, the dramatic increase in patterning time close to the boundary predicted from the deterministic case is substantially reduced. The resulting stochastic switching introduces differences in patterning time along the morphogen gradient that result in a patterning wave propagating away from the morphogen source with a velocity determined by the intrinsic noise. The wave sharpens and slows as it advances and may never reach steady state in a biologically relevant time. This could explain experimentally observed dynamics of pattern formation. Together the analysis reveals the importance of dynamical transients for understanding morphogen-driven transcriptional networks and indicates that gene expression noise can qualitatively alter developmental patterning.},

    abstract={Quantifying stochastic processes is essential to understand many natural phenomena, particularly in biology, including the cell-fate decision in developmental processes as well as the genesis and progression of cancers. While various attempts have been made to construct potential landscape in high dimensional systems and to estimate transition rates, they are practically limited to the cases where either noise is small or detailed balance condition holds. A general and practical approach to investigate real-world nonequilibrium systems, which are typically high-dimensional and subject to large multiplicative noise and the breakdown of detailed balance, remains elusive. Here, we formulate a computational framework that can directly compute the relative probabilities between locally stable states of such systems based on a least action method, without the necessity of simulating the steady-state distribution. The method can be applied to systems with arbitrary noise intensities through A-type stochastic integration, which preserves the dynamical structure of the deterministic counterpart dynamics. We demonstrate our approach in a numerically accurate manner through solvable examples. We further apply the method to investigate the role of noise on tumor heterogeneity in a 38-dimensional network model for prostate cancer, and provide a new strategy on controlling cell populations by manipulating noise strength.},

    abstract = {Consider a two-dimensional continuous-time dynamical system, with an attracting fixed point S. If the deterministic dynamics are perturbed by white noise (random perturbations) of strength ε, the system state will eventually leave the domain of attraction Ω of S. We analyze the case when, as ε → 0, the exit location on the boundary ∂Ω is increasingly concentrated near a saddle point H of the deterministic dynamics. We show using formal methods that the asymptotic form of the exit location distribution on ∂Ω is generically non-Gaussian and asymmetric, and classify the possible limiting distributions. A key role is played by a parameter μ, equal to the ratio |λs(H)|λu(H) of the stable and unstable eigenvalues of the linearized deterministic flow at H. If $\mu < 1$, then the exit location distribution is generically asymptotic as ε → 0 to a Weibull distribution with shape parameter 2/μ, on the O(εμ/2) lengthscale near H. If $\mu > 1$, it is generically asymptotic to a distribution on the O(ε1/2) lengthscale, whose moments we compute. Our treatment employs both matched asymptotic expansions and stochastic analysis. As a byproduct of our treatment, we clarify the limitations of the traditional Eyring formula for the weak-noise exit time asymptotics.},

The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},
