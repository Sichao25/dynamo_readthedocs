We would like to sincerely thank the developers of velocyto (La Manno Gioele and others), scanpy (Alex Wolf and others) and svelo (Volker Bergen and others) on their amazing tools which demonstrate the best practice of scientific programming in Python. Dynamo takes various technical inspiration from those packages. It also provides full compatibilities with them. Velocity estimations from either velocyto or scvelo can both be used as input in dynamo to learn the functional form of vector field and then to predict the cell fate over extended time period as well as to map global cell state potential.
